QPanttays is a simple flashcard application for studying vocabularies
or any other material.

The target platform at the moment is Nokia N9 smartphone, but the
application should run with minimal modifications on any other
platform supporting Qt/QML. Actually the Qt Creator handles
at least Symbian and Maemo smartphones, plus the normal desktop
target.


== Installation ==

1. Open qpanttays.pro with Qt Creator

2. Build for your target

3. At your handheld, enter the SDK mode. For that, you might
  need to install some developer mode packages.

3. Run the application. That will install the app into the phone.


== Installing Card Decks ==

1. Download ready-made flashcard files or write your own.

2. Deck file format is CSV (Comma Separated Values).
  Each line in the file shall be in this format:
"fact1","fact2","fact3"
(note the double quotes)

  Fact count can be anything, however text size change for
  three facts is supported at the moment.

  You can use any utility or other flashcard program to export
  decks in CSV format. Quite many flashcard apps support
  this. Tip: spreadsheets are handy adding/removing columns.

3. Connect to the smartphone/handheld with data cable or
  other means. Copy the card deck file into one of
  these locations:
  ~/.qpanttays
  ~/MyDocs/.qpanttays
  (Note: ~ means the home directory of the normal user.)
  Other mechanisms such as an import wizard has been planned.
